# Session 0 Summary

## Frederick's Rebellion

_Your ship is missing the right thruster. It's a little inconvenient not being able to turn left, but you can manage. After all, not everyone is an ambi-turner._

Fred the Pirate has suspected that his Quartermaster Frederick is planning a mutiny. Undermine, prevent, or mutiny the mutiny and Fred prove an engine drive for your ship.

Judging from his navigation logs, he has been hopping between bars to recruit some muscle to back him up. His next recruitment stop will be in The Nebula, a seedy bar on the outskirts of the Cromulon sector.

## Steve-O's Travelling Circus

_Without a nav-system you'll run into trouble trying to traverse galaxy._

Steve-O's Travelling Circus has stopped by in the Cromulon Galaxy for an unexpected suprise! Luckily for you we have reason to believe that he has a spare nav-system lying around. Unfortunately, his star-act has space-osteoperosis and his funny bone isn't working as it used to. He's looking for some special guests to sub-in for his headliner act. Impress the crowd and Steve-O and that nav-system is as good as yours.

I've stopped using a nav-system, it's too predictable and boring to know where you'll end up. Plus I'd like my arrivals to be suprises, even to myself!
Visited Steve-O's office (bouncy castle).
