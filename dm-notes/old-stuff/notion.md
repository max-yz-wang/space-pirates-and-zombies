Players enter the SWMG room and are briefed

Our intel has decided that you X are the best best for our next transplant effort.

We need you to travel the galaxy and collect culturally significant artifacts and bring them to the centre of the universe. Once you reach there, this box will unlock and has some instructions. We will support you from the shadows on your journey. You musn’t let anyone know of your mission. Each of you have a key role to play in this journey.
If you defect, we will erase all knowledge of your existence and the world will continue without any hint of your existsnce.

Provides the team with funds, equipment, and other stuff.

Come with us,

takes the players to ship surrounded by a _Somebody else’s problem field._ There is a great deal of knowledge of ancient technology that has been lost, we are the keepers of knowledge of history. Intergalactic librarians as you will. But power hungry factions seek to use our knowledge for destruction and conquest, therefore we must remain secret and keep the universe in balance. Whenever a faction grows too strong we shift the tides ever so slightly to keep the eternal conflict ongoing lest they discover and turn their ire onto us.

The players travel to some undisclosed junkyard on a moon of Hawkin III a derelict mining station. _We have provided you with a worthy vessel for your journey. We brought together the top engineers from each faction and as such, have made it modular and compatible with hardware and software from any faction. Pirate you are responsible for maintaining the vessel and ensuring that it is configured for the climate of any hazardous planets you reach._

It also has ancient tech a fax machine for one-way correspondence with SWMG.

Printed on synth-paper is a couple of items.

_We ran out of budget for this millenia’s galaxy-run. Here’s a list of favours to complete to finish the ship. kthnx -SWMG  
ps MAKE SURE U CLEAN BEFORE RETURNING THE SHIP xoxoxo_

## Missing Space Modules

Before you embark on your journey you need to get your ship up to snuff.

### VBucks

There’s a toll-road leading out of the Cromulon Galaxy. You would do well to generate some savings as well. Accumulate 2000 vBucks for your journey.

Trading Runs, Deliveries, Mining, Debris Cleanup, Research, Biological Surveying

### Missing Thruster

_A little inconvenient since you can only turn right._

Intelligence has a local SP has rumors of mutiny, assist in shutting it down and guy will give you an engine drive. He’ll be hiring a crew at the Nebula Pirate Bar for his mutiny, infiltrate his effort and mutiny his mutiny.

### Communications Module

_Intermittently pings your location. Travelling without this module is illegal and is equivalent to driving without registration. This can be disabled if you enter an asteroid field to do some shady dealings._

You must travel to the space-dmv and take the space-driving exam.

### Hydroponics System

_FTL travel has the side-effect of greatly increased metabolism. You’ll need to upgrade hydroponics system to Grade 4 in order provide enough calories for your FTL jumps. The easiest way is to capture a dwarf-star and minituarise it for your light-source at your local Hydroponics Facility. That way you’ll be able to purchase G4 industrial-grade ultra-dense supersoil._

### Shields

_Rogue asteroids or miscellaneous debris will be catastrophic if you travel without shields._

### FTL Drive

_Without an FTL drive you’ll be stuck in the Cromulon Sector for the next few lifetimes._

### Ship Exterior

_The vessel has been heavily vandalised… you’ll need to take it to the space-car-wash and maybe get a nifty paintjob._

### Missiles and Beam Cartridges

_Currently your weapons are just for show. If a desparate pirate calls your bluff, you’ll have a rough time when the hull is shredded apart._

### Navigation Console

Steve-O the great has a spare navigation console (it’s a bop-it duct taped to the screen)

### Boarding Module

Pirate: grapple hook

Zombie: personnel missile pods

Ninjas: teleporter

Clowns: none
