my rambuncious homebrew d&amp;d setting

# Elevator Pitch
In this setting there are four main factions, space pirates, space zombies, ninjas and clowns. Each faction is vying to secure power of the universe by enacting a voyage to the centre of the universe they can enact their will upon the galaxy to their benefit. 

You each come from one of these factions, brought together by the Shadow Government. You have been tasked with the mission to maintain the balance of the universe. In doing so, you must collect an assortment of rare artifacts and bring them to the centre of the universe to enact the Shadow Governmentâ€™s will. 

You all meet at The Nexus, a space-station that orbits an anomaly that allows for the factions to communicate freely with one another. 

Travel from planet to planet collecting artifacts, making alliances, and dungeon crawling ancient space-ruins, make shady deals with illegal arms-dealers, fight behemoths and titans.
